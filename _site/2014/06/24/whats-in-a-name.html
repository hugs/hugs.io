<h1>What's in a Name</h1>

<p>When he got to me, I extended my hand and said the customary "Nice to meet you, Mr. President."</p>

<p>I added, "My name is Jason, but my nickname is 'Hugs'."</p>

<p>He FROZE.</p>

<p>It was only for a moment, but felt like a minute. "Oh no," I thought to myself. What have I done?</p>

<p>Then he smiled, and said, "Come on, you get a hug!"</p>

<p>Everyone else was like "Wait, you got a hug!?"</p>

<p>Later, someone came up with a theory on why he froze: The president was just glad my nickname wasn't "French kiss".</p>

<h3>Epilogue</h3>

<p>I've told this story a few times, and I now realize I have to clarify something: He hugged me. I went in for the handshake, but he escalated. No begging for a hug here!</p>

<p>Ironically, Iâ€™m more of a fist bump guy. But he'll never know.</p>
